To create an XSD schema file and an RDLC report file in an MVC application and make a connection between them, you can follow these general steps:

Create an XSD schema file:

In Visual Studio, right-click on your project and select "Add" -> "New Item".
In the "Add New Item" dialog box, select "XML Schema" and name the file.
Define the schema structure and elements in the XSD file.
Create an RDLC report file:

In Visual Studio, right-click on your project and select "Add" -> "New Item".
In the "Add New Item" dialog box, select "Report" -> "Report Wizard".
Follow the wizard to define the report data source, layout, and design.
When you reach the "Choose Your Data Source" step in the wizard, select "Object" as the data source type and select the XSD file you created in step 1.
Make a connection between the XSD and RDLC files:

In the RDLC report file, go to the "Data" tab and click on the "Add New Data Source" button.
Select "Object" as the data source type and select the XSD file you created in step 1.
Follow the prompts to select the appropriate table or schema from the XSD file.
Once you have completed the wizard, you should see the data source listed in the "Data Sources" window.
Display the report in your MVC application:

In your MVC application, create a controller method that returns an ActionResult for the report view.
In the view for the report, use the ReportViewer control to display the report.
Set the ReportViewer control's ProcessingMode to "Local" and its ReportPath property to the path of the RDLC report file.
Bind the data source to the report using the ReportDataSource object.
These are general steps, and the exact implementation details may vary depending on your specific requirements and the version of Visual Studio you are using.
